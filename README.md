# Wine-Classification

We used load_wine data from sklearn.datasets. The shape of the dataset after cleanup and transformation is linear. The independent variables are- Alcohol,
Malic acid,Ash,Alcalinity of ash ,Magnesium Total phenols,Flavanoids,Nonflavanoid phenols,Proanthocyanin, Color intensity,Hue and the dependent variables 
are Medgroups. The shapes of the training data is linear and it is also linear for the testing data. The coefficient of determination is 0.9 and the correlation 
coefficient is 1.0. The attributes that have the most influence are ash,flavinoids,alcohol,phenol(looking at the graph) and the least influence are the rest. 
This shows that for successful and tasty wine we have to include our strong influenced elements like alcohol,phenol etc. Our models predictions show the more 
the strong influenced flavors are included,the more the wine will be tasty. The correlation between the predicted values and the expected values of the dependent 
variable are relatively strong since it shows the regression linearly.
